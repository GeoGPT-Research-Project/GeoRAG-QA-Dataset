## GeoRAG-QA: A Benchmark Test Set for Geoscience Information Retrieval

### 1. Dataset Description

We introduce **GeoRAG-QA**, a curated test set designed for evaluating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and information retrieval approaches in the geoscience domain.

GeoRAG-QA was constructed using the Test Set Generation module from [RAGAS (Es et al., 2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15217). The dataset consists of automatically generated QA items based on open-access geoscience publications (see [GeoGPT Training Data from Open Access Papers](https://github.com/GeoGPT-Research-Project/GeoGPT/blob/main/GeoGPT%20Training%20Data%20from%20Open%20Access%20Papers.md) for reference), licensed under CC BY or CC BY-NC. During the generation process, some QA items were incomplete or invalid. After manual review, these flawed entries were removed, yielding a final set of **938** high-quality QA items. The dataset is organized into four categories:

- 250 single-document fact-based QA pairs
- 250 single-document inference QA pairs
- 188 multi-document QA pairs
- 250 conditional QA pairs

In cases where the generated reference answer was incorrectly labeled as “The answer to the given question is not present in the context”, we re-generated the reference answers using GPT-4o to improve accuracy, consistency, and evaluation reliability.
